      Use this tool to get an OpenShift Partner Lab based on its current state.
      The state can be one of the following states: <pending|approved|active|extended|denied|completed>
      DO NOT use this tool to get an OpenShift Partner Lab except when the user is asking to return a lab based
      on the lab's current state.
      This tool queries a MySQL database and returns a list of JSON objects where each object contains all the 
      information about a lab.
      Example:
      {{
          "state": "active"
      }}
    parameters:
      - name: state
        type: string
        description: The state of the lab; one of active|approved|pending|completed
    statement: SELECT * FROM labs WHERE state LIKE ?;
